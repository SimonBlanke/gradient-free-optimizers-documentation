# Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle swarm optimization works by initializing a number of positions at the same time and moving all of those closer to the best one after each iteration.

**Available parameters:**
- n_particles
- inertia
- cognitive_weight
- social_weight

---

**Use case/properties:**
- If the search space is complex and large
- If you have enough time for many model evaluations
